/*
Create a Promise that simulates a data fetching operation with a delay. 
Introduce a cancellation token that can be used to cancel the Promise before it resolves.

If the operation is cancelled, the Promise should reject with a 
“Cancelled” message; otherwise, it should resolve normally.

Cancel it!
